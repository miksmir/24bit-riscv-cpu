# 24bit-riscv-cpu
A 24-bit CPU is designed and simulated in Verilog to execute from a predetermined set of sixteen custom instructions that will output a 24-bit binary output to memory-mapped peripherals. 

A 24-bit CPU is designed and simulated in Verilog to execute from a predetermined set of sixteen custom instructions that will output a 24-bit binary output to memory-mapped peripherals. 
The two peripherals implemented are a 24-bit timer and a 16-bit integer divider. The designed CPU is able to read and write data to and from memory, perform arithmetic and logic operations, and can interact with peripherals, and is simulated using testbenches.

See the PDF report for more details of the implementation, such as the instruction set used, the opcodes, and the simulation results.

NOTE: This project was a group effort between Mikhail Smirnov, Ray Reshef, Yordan Nikolov, and Adina Tsibulevskiy.
